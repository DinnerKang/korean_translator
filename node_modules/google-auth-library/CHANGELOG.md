### Bug Fixes
- fix(deps): upgrade to the latest gaxios ([#596](https://github.com/googleapis/google-auth-library-nodejs/pull/596))

## v3.0.0

01-16-2019 10:00 PST

Welcome to 3.0 ðŸŽ‰  This release has it all.  New features, bug fixes, breaking changes, performance improvements - something for everyone!  The biggest addition to this release is support for the browser via Webpack.

**This release has breaking changes.**  This release has a few breaking changes. These changes are unlikely to affect most clients.

#### BREAKING: Migration from `axios` to `gaxios`
The 2.0 version of this library used the [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) library for making HTTP requests. In the 3.0 release, this has been replaced by a *mostly* API compatible library [gaxios](https://github.com/JustinBeckwith/gaxios). The new request library natively supports proxies, and comes with a smaller dependency chain. While this is mostly an implementation detail, the `request` method was directly exposed via the `GoogleAuth.request` and `OAuth2Client.request` methods.  The gaxios library aims to provide an API compatible implementation of axios, but that can never be 100% promised.  If you run into bugs or differences that cause issues - please do let us know.

#### BREAKING: `generateCodeVerifier` is now `generateCodeVerifierAsync`
The `OAuth2Client.generateCodeVerifier` method has been replaced by the `OAuth2Client.generateCodeVerifierAsync` method.  It has changed from a synchronous method to an asynchronous method to support async browser crypto APIs required for Webpack support.

#### BREAKING: `generateCodeVerifier` is now `generateCodeVerifierAsync`
The `OAuth2Client.verifySignedJwtWithCerts` method has been replaced by the `OAuth2Client.verifySignedJwtWithCerts` method.  It has changed from a synchronous method to an asynchronous method to support async browser crypto APIs required for Webpack support.

## v2.0.0

Well hello 2.0 ðŸŽ‰  **This release has multiple breaking changes**.   It also has a lot of bug fixes.

### Breaking Changes

#### Support for node.js 4.x and 9.x has been dropped
These versions of node.js are no longer supported.

#### The `getRequestMetadata` method has been deprecated
The `getRequestMetadata` method has been deprecated on the `IAM`, `OAuth2`, `JWT`, and `JWTAccess` classes.  The `getRequestHeaders` method should be used instead.  The methods have a subtle difference:  the `getRequestMetadata` method returns an object with a headers property, which contains the authorization header.  The `getRequestHeaders` method simply returns the headers.

##### Old code
```js
const client = await auth.getClient();
const res = await client.getRequestMetadata();
const headers = res.headers;
```

##### New code
```js
const client = await auth.getClient();
const headers = await client.getRequestHeaders();
```

#### The `createScopedRequired` method has been deprecated
The `createScopedRequired` method has been deprecated on multiple classes.  The `createScopedRequired` and `createScoped` methods on the `JWT` class were largely in place to help inform clients when scopes were required in an application default credential scenario.  Instead of checking if scopes are required after creating the client, instead scopes should just be passed either into the `GoogleAuth.getClient` method, or directly into the `JWT` constructor.

##### Old code
```js
auth.getApplicationDefault(function(err, authClient) {
   if (err) {
     return callback(err);
   }
  if (authClient.createScopedRequired && authClient.createScopedRequired()) {
    authClient = authClient.createScoped([
      'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform'
    ]);
  }
  callback(null, authClient);
});
```

##### New code
```js
const client = await auth.getClient({
  scopes: ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform']
});
```

#### The `refreshAccessToken` method has been deprecated
The `OAuth2.refreshAccessToken` method has been deprecated.  The `getAccessToken`, `getRequestMetadata`, and `request` methods will all refresh the token if needed automatically.   There is no need to ever manually refresh the token.

As always, if you run into any problems... please let us know!
